                                </ul><h3>2. How Does Capita Fintech Collect Information?&nbsp;</h3><p>We and our service providers collect Personal Data and Other Information in a variety of ways, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Through the Sites:&nbsp;&nbsp;We collect information through the Sites, e.g., when you request a free trial or demo, register for a webinar, contact us, subscribe to our email newsletter, download content (e.g. whitepapers), or register to use our Sites.</li>

                                <li>Through You:&nbsp;Capita Fintech collects information such as your location or your preferred means of communication when you voluntarily provide it. Unless combined with Personal Data, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Sites.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>Information From Other Sources:&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers, and services to you, we obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.</li>
                                <li>Through Your Browser or Device:&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Sites (such as the Apps) you are using. Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you access the Sites, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that you visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. Capita Fintech uses IP Addresses to calculate usage levels of the Sites, help diagnose problems with its servers, administer the Sites, and for monitoring the regions from which you navigate to CF’s Sites.</li>
                                <li>Through Your Use of the Apps:&nbsp;&nbsp;When you download and use an App, we and our service providers track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</li>
                                <li>Through Cookies and Other Similar Technologies:&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cookies" include commonly used pieces of information in the form of small files that are placed on an individual’s device to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Sites.&nbsp;When you visit our Sites, we may send one or more cookies to your device.&nbsp;&nbsp;They enable us to store information about your device which helps us, amongst other things, to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Sites and enhance the level of services and functions provided.&nbsp;We also use third parties to serve advertisements on other websites that may be of interest to you, based on information collected about your use of our Sites and other websites.&nbsp;To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie or similar on your browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;Capita Fintech recognizes automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include ‘do not track’ instructions.
                                <li>By Aggregating Information:&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggregated Personal Data does not personally identify you or any other user of the Sites (for example, we may aggregate Personal Data to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).</li>
                                </ul><h3>3.

Please do not post any information that you do not want to reveal to the public at large.&nbsp;</p><h5>Business Transfers:&nbsp;</h5><p>In some cases, we buy or sell assets or businesses. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Capita Fintech will disclose Personal Data to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).&nbsp;</p><h5>Profiling and Automated Decision-making:</h5><p>Capita Fintech combines data obtained by the methods described in Section 2 to help us determine what products and services might be of interest to you and when you might be ready to make a purchase based on repeated interaction with Capita Fintech websites, emails, and content.

How Does Capita Fintech Secure Personal Data About Me?&nbsp;</h3><p>We have implemented appropriate organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect Personal Data within our organization, including security controls to prevent unauthorized access to our systems. While we take reasonable steps to secure your Personal Data from loss, misuse, interference and unauthorized access, modification and disclosure, you should be aware no security procedures or protocols are ever guaranteed to be 100 percent secure from intrusion or hacking, and there is therefore always some risk assumed by sharing Personal Data online. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Questions, Concerns and Complaints” section below.&nbsp;</p><h3>7.
